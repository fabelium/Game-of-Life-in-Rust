# Game of Life in Rust

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life, written in Rust. The primary purpose of this project is to serve as an exercise to learn and practice Rust.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input during the game.

## How It Works
In the Game of Life, each cell in a two-dimensional grid can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell changes in each turn of the game according to a set of simple rules related to the number of living neighbors.

This project implements these rules and provides a basic visualization of the game board.

## Technologies Used
- Rust

## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, you need to have Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Cloning the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/fabelium/Game-of-Life-in-Rust.git
cd Game-of-Life-in-Rust
```

### Running the Game

To run the game, use the following command from the root of the project:

```
cargo run
```

This will compile the project and start the game. You should see the game's output in your terminal.
